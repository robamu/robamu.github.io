small Rust ecosystem for the Vorago REB1 development board. This development board also
has a MAX11619 10-bit ADC device by Maxim devices. I thought this was a good opportunity
to develop my first device driver crate because there isn&amp;rsquo;t one for this device yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The REB1 development board also has a 2K potentiometer connected directly to a channel of the ADC
which makes testing convenient.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bringing Rust to Space - Setting up a Rust ecosystem for the VA108XX MCU family</title><link>https://robamu.github.io/blog/rust-ecosystem/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 23:31:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://robamu.github.io/blog/rust-ecosystem/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="update-2024">UPDATE 2024&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I have recently converted the VA108xx Rust support into monocrates which can now be found
&lt;a href="https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/rust/va108xx-rs">here&lt;/a>. I have also started working on the
support for the VA416XX family of devices which can be found &lt;a href="https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/rust/va416xx-rs">here&lt;/a>.
The new repositories also now use the &lt;code>embedded-hal&lt;/code> v1 release.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The last few weeks I have been busy diving into the Rust ecosystem and learning the language
through practical projects. I finishing the excellent
&lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">Rust book&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/">Rust Embedded Book&lt;/a>
first and then tinkered with Rust on some STM32 MCUs. As a next step, I was looking for practical
projects to further learn the language. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to combine this with the usual activities at
the research institute I work now as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Throwback - GSoC 2020 | Device handler development for the SOURCE project</title><link>https://robamu.github.io/blog/gsoc-post/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 19:29:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://robamu.github.io/blog/gsoc-post/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is an adapted version of a blog post initially posted
&lt;a href="https://aerospaceresearch.net/?p=1912">on Wordpress&lt;/a> as part of my GSoC project. It&amp;rsquo;s a perfect
way for me to set up my own first blog which is based on
&lt;a href="https://youngkin.github.io/post/createafreeblogsite/">this excellent guide&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At that point of time, I was an aerospace engineer doing my graduate studies at the University
of Stuttgart. I&amp;rsquo;m still active in the small satellite society &lt;a href="https://www.ksat-stuttgart.de/en/">KSat&lt;/a>
but I am doing more of a supporting role now that I started working the University as a PhD student.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
